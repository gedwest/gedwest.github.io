I've been meaning to start a new blog and portfolio for some time now. But in the past when I've
started them I've always left them neglected and forgotten after just a few short weeks.
So this time I decided to do something different that I'd feel more personally invested in: rather than just use a WordPress or Blogger template, I coded my own portfolio site and blog.

Whether you have vast experience of HTML/CSS and GitHub, or none, the entire process
is rather easy and a good way to develop, and *prove*, your skills.

If you're looking to make something similar yourself, try the [Knight Lab tutorial](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/08/02/how-to-portfolio-sites-for-journalists-github-makes-em-cheap-and-kinda-easy/), or if you don't like the standard Jekyll template (Jekyll is a static site generator - find out more by clicking on the links) try this tutorial by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/
).

As for this blog itself, I intend to use it as a platform to experiment with new skills that I learn, and as somewhere to post writings of mine that don't quite fit with any other platforms that I'm involved in.
