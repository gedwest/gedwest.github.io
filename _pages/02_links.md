Here's a selection of articles I've written over the past year or so. Its not an exhaustive list,
just a handful of things that I kinda like, and you may (hopefully) like to.

**Laboratory News**

*[Where does Theresa May stand on science and engineering?](http://www.labnews.co.uk/comment/theresa-may-stand-science-engineering-29-08-2016/)* (29/09/16) (Not gonna lie, this was just a quick redraft of my CaSE article, for print in Lab News' monthly magazine.)

**Campaign For Science and Engineering:**

**Pi Media:**

Ahh Pi. I joined the student magazine and website as the Science & Technology editor, a role I only stayed in for a few short months, before ascending to the Editorship of Pi Online, UCL's biggest student media platform. I had a great laugh running Pi, and had fun experimenting with a range of journalistic areas. From news on rent strikes, to the science of hangovers, and even a blog on learning to ballroom dance. Here's a selection of pieces I wrote whilst there.
